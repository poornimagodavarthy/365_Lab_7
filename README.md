This application is an inn/hotel reservation system that allows a user to view available rooms as well as room and pricing details, book a reservation, cancel a reservation, search existng reservations, and view total revenue for the hotel system.

If a user attempts to make a reservation, but cannot be matched to a room as per their exact requirements, we suggest rooms based on the availability of the rooms within a 50-day window from the check-in or check-out date, rank based on popularity (based on previous bookings), price, and maximum occupancy.

Note: This program is case sensitive, so all names must be entered in upper case when searching reservations.

To run this program: python3 main.py
